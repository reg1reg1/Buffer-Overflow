#Part of the exploit-3 in PA with SP3 XP and exploit of the same name which has a different overflow behavior
#in this the program prevents overwrite of anything past the return address.
#Our shellcode cannot come after the ret, but instead precede it. The ret address points to an address lower in memory (Against buffer growth direction)
#We can have nop,shellcode,nop,retaddress
